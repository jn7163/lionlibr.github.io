	<p>The Lion of Liberty Library (&ldquo;LionLibr&rdquo;) is all about 
	freedom. It includes a collection of documents related to censorship
	circumvention. This is outer freedom. 
	There exists also inner freedom &mdash; liberation from personal 
	conditioning. This means no longer being driven by obsolete responses.</p>
	
	<p><a href="posts/v2ray-centos-android-tutorial.html"><strong>V2Ray on CentOS and Android Tutorial</strong></a>
	V2Ray is a popular method of censorship circumvention. It has the 
	capability to communicate using the HTTP-like WebSocket protocol. 
	This assists in camouflaging the communication between your client 
	and your server.
	In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll see how to install V2Ray on a CentOS 
	server and an Android client. The server is further protected 
	by being behind a content distribution network (CDN).
	This arrangement is sometimes referred to by the shorthand notation 
	&ldquo;V2Ray+WS+TLS+CDN.&rdquo;
	CentOS is an unbranded recompilation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux,
	which in turn is based on Fedora after extensive testing.
	New releases of CentOS are issued approximately every five years, 
	and at the time of writing the latest release is CentOS 8.
	Android continues to be the most popular mobile operating 
system, running on around five out of every six mobile devices.</p>
	
	<p><a href="posts/trojan-gfw-debian-windows-tutorial.html"><strong>Trojan-GFW on Debian and Windows Tutorial</strong></a>
	Trojan aims to help you bypass the Great Firewall (GFW) of China. 
	It features multiple protocols over Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
	to avoid both active and passive detection and 
	Internet Service Provider (ISP) Quality-of-Service (QoS) limitations.
	In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll learn how to install Trojan-GFW 
	on a Debian server and a Windows client.</p>
	
	<p><a href="posts/naiveproxy-debian-windows-tutorial.html"><strong>NaiveProxy on Debian and Windows Tutorial</strong></a>
	NaiveProxy uses Chrome&rsquo;s network stack to camouflage traffic and 
	provide stronger censorship resistance than custom-made network stacks. It 
	aims to resist both fingerprinting and active probing. Reusing 
	Chrome&rsquo;s stack ensures that NaiveProxy implements best practices 
	in performance and security. In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll learn how to 
	install NaiveProxy on a Debian server and a Windows client.
	Debian is a long-established and highly respected Linux distribution. It is 
	popular with server administrators. New releases are issued every few 
	years, and at the time of writing the latest release is Debian 10.
	Windows 10 continues to be Microsoft&rsquo;s most popular desktop operating 
	system, running on around half of all desktop computers.</p>
	
	<p><a href="posts/v2ray-websocket-ubuntu-tutorial.html"><strong>V2Ray+WebSocket Ubuntu Tutorial</strong></a>
	V2Ray is a popular method to cross the Great Firewall (GFW) of China. 
	WebSocket (WS) is a protocol that upgrades an HTTP connection to provide full-duplex communication over a single TCP connection. V2Ray has the capability to communicate using the HTTP-like WebSocket protocol. This 
	assists in camouflaging the communication between your client and your 
	server. In this tutorial, you'll see how to set up V2Ray+WebSocket on an 
	Ubuntu server and an Ubuntu client. Ubuntu Linux is released every six 
	months, with long-term support (LTS) releases every two years. The version 
	you&rsquo;ll see demonstrated in this tutorial is the most recent LTS 
	version, which at the time of writing is Ubuntu 18.04.</p>
