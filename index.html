	<p>The Lion of Liberty Library (&ldquo;LionLibr&rdquo;) is all about 
	freedom. It includes a collection of documents related to censorship
	circumvention. This is outer freedom. 
	There exists also inner freedom &mdash; liberation from personal 
	conditioning. This means no longer being driven by obsolete responses.
	Here&rsquo;s what you can read on this site.</p>
	
	<p><a href="posts/one-click-v2ray-ws-tls-script.html"><strong>One-Click V2Ray+WS+TLS Script</strong></a>
	V2Ray is an open-source network proxy tool that can help you better enjoy 
	the Internet. It can be used on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and Linux 
	clients. V2Ray offers many sophisticated features. However, it can be 
	difficult for beginners to configure.
	This tutorial introduces a one-click installation script that does much of 
	the work of V2Ray server configuration for you.</p>
	
	<p><a href="posts/openconnect-debian-android.html"><strong>OpenConnect on Debian and Android</strong></a>
	OpenConnect sometimes gets through in environments where other protocols 
	fail. It is a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) virtual private network (VPN). 
	This means that it uses the same Transport Layer Security (TLS) as is used 
	by ordinary websites that support HTTPS. The consequence is that 
	OpenConnect can often pass by censors undetected. It has also 
	(currently experimental) compatibility with clients using the AnyConnect 
	SSL VPN protocol.</p>
	
	<p><a href="posts/trojan-gfw-centos-igniter-android.html"><strong>Trojan-GFW on CentOS, Igniter on Android</strong></a>
	In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll see how to install Trojan on a CentOS 
	server. We&rsquo;ll go on to install Igniter on an Android device.
	Igniter is a Trojan client that is still under active development,
	so it may have changed substantially by the time 
	you read this tutorial.</p>
	
	<p><a href="posts/clash-for-windows-tutorial.html"><strong>Clash for Windows Tutorial</strong></a>
	Clash is a cross-platform proxy client written in Go. 
	It supports Shadowsocks and V2Ray servers, though not ShadowsocksR. 
	The core Clash client is available for macOS, FreeBSD, Linux, and Windows. 
	“Clash for Windows” is a graphical user interface (GUI) 
	for Clash on Windows. This tutorial will demonstrate both core Clash 
	from the command line on a Windows platform 
	and the Clash for Windows GUI.</p>
	
	<p><a href="posts/gost-tutorial.html"><strong>Gost Tutorial</strong></a>
	Go Simple Tunnel (Gost) is tunneling software written in the Go language. 
	It connects local nodes to forward nodes, possibly in a chain. 
	Supported protocols include HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP/2, SOCKS4(A), and SOCKS5.
	In this tutorial, we present a simple case where traffic from one client 
	is tunneled to one server. The tunneling protocol in this example 
	is HTTP/2.</p>
	
	<p><a href="posts/v2ray-centos-android-tutorial.html"><strong>V2Ray on CentOS and Android Tutorial</strong></a>
	In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll see how to install V2Ray on a CentOS 
	server and an Android client. The server is further protected 
	by being behind a content distribution network (CDN).
	This arrangement is sometimes referred to by the shorthand notation 
	&ldquo;V2Ray+WS+TLS+CDN.&rdquo;</p>
	
	<p><a href="posts/trojan-gfw-debian-windows-tutorial.html"><strong>Trojan-GFW on Debian and Windows Tutorial</strong></a>
	Trojan aims to help you bypass the Great Firewall (GFW) of China. 
	It features multiple protocols over Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
	to avoid both active and passive detection and 
	Internet Service Provider (ISP) Quality-of-Service (QoS) limitations.</p>
	
	<p><a href="posts/naiveproxy-debian-windows-tutorial.html"><strong>NaiveProxy on Debian and Windows Tutorial</strong></a>
	NaiveProxy uses Chrome&rsquo;s network stack to camouflage traffic and 
	provide stronger censorship resistance than custom-made network stacks. It 
	aims to resist both fingerprinting and active probing. Reusing 
	Chrome&rsquo;s stack ensures that NaiveProxy implements best practices 
	in performance and security.</p>
	
	<p><a href="posts/v2ray-websocket-ubuntu-tutorial.html"><strong>V2Ray+WebSocket Ubuntu Tutorial</strong></a>
	V2Ray is a popular method to cross the Great Firewall (GFW) of China. 
	WebSocket (WS) is a protocol that upgrades an HTTP connection to provide full-duplex communication over a single TCP connection. V2Ray has the capability to communicate using the HTTP-like WebSocket protocol. This 
	assists in camouflaging the communication between your client and your 
	server.</p>
